# An investigation into Functional Linear Regression Modeling

## Preface

This academic paper was submitted for the degree of Master of Science at the University of Cape Town (South Africa). The study was conducted under the supervision of Associate Professor Sugnet Lubbe in the Department of Mathematical Statistics, University of Cape Town.

## Abstract

Functional data analysis, commonly known as _FDA_, refers to the analysis of information on curves of functions. Key aspects of _FDA_ include the choice of smoothing techniques, data reduction, model evaluation, functional linear modelling and forecasting methods. _FDA_ is applicable in numerous applications such as Bioscience, Geology, Psychology, Sports Science, Econometrics, Meteorology, etc.
This dissertation main objective is to focus more specifically on Functional Linear Regression Modeling (_FLRM_), which is an extension of Multivariate Linear Regression Modeling. The problem of constructing a Functional Linear Regression modeling with functional predictors and functional response variable is considered in great details. Discretely observed data for each variable involved in the modeling are expressed as smooth functions using: _Fourier Basis_, _B-Splines Basis_ and _Gaussian Basis_. The Functional Linear Regression Model is estimated by the _Least Square method_, _Maximum Likelihood method_ and more thoroughly by _Penalized Maximum Likelihood method_. A central issue when modeling Functional Regression models is the choice of a suitable model criterion as well as the number of basis functions and an appropriate smoothing parameter. Four different types of model criteria are reviewed: the _Generalized Cross-Validation_, the _Generalized Information Criterion_, the _modified Akaike Information Criterion_ and _Generalized Bayesian Information Criterion_. Each of these aforementioned methods are applied to a dataset and contrasted based on their respective results.

## Keywords: 
_Functional Data Analysis_, _Basis Expansion_, _Functional Regression_, _Smoothing Techniques_.
